## [0.3.18](https://github.com/cschroeter/ng2-pickadate/compare/0.3.17...0.3.18) (2016-09-22)


### Bug Fixes

* use ng2-pickadate as a directive instead of a component, that the datepicker may be used on different components ([b792a1e](https://github.com/cschroeter/ng2-pickadate/commit/b792a1e))
* workaround to use datepicker until the webpack-configuration could be modified ([e60f98b](https://github.com/cschroeter/ng2-pickadate/commit/e60f98b))


### Features

* implement disable-date, placeholder properties and formControl ([18c8fe6](https://github.com/cschroeter/ng2-pickadate/commit/18c8fe6))
